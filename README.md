# Immunometabolic profiles of depressive symptom trajectories
This repository contains R scripts used for analyses in the paper "Immunometabolic Blood Biomarkers of Developmental Trajectories of Depressive Symptoms: Findings from the ALSPAC Birth Cohort" ([preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.12.24310330)).

## Contents
- 01_latent_trajectories.R - models latent trajectories of depressive symptoms from childhood to early adulthood
- 02_inflammatory_proteins.R - tests associations between trajectory class membership and circulating inflammatory proteins
- 03_metabolomics.R - tests assocations between trajectory class membership and metabolomic features
- 04_cell_counts_biochemistry.R - tests associations between trajectory class membership and blood cell counts and clinical biochemistry markers

## Data availability
This project used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). ALSPAC data access is through a system of [managed open access](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/access/).
